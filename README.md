# Add Cities to VIVO

Add cities in the United States with population over 100,000 in 2012 to VIVO.

Each city has a name and a state.

Look up the state in VIVO.  If not found, throw an error -- all the states need to be in VIVO.

Look up the city in VIVO.  Update the state if not found in VIVO.

## Note

There's nothing US specific about this code.  The data file contains US cities.  Edit the data file
to add cities of interest in provinces or states of interest.

## To Do

1. The data contains longitude and latitude.  When we learn how to put these in VIVO, we will add them
to add_cities.
1. Create a round trip export to reproduce the data file from VIVO.  In this way, we can manage the city data
from a spreadsheet.
1. Add the code and data to Simple VIVO as one of the delivered data packages.
