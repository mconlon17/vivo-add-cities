# Add US Cities to VIVO

Create a data package of cities for VIVO.

Each city has a name, a state, a latitude and a longitude.

Look up the state in VIVO.  All the states need to be in VIVO.  Will link to the
default states as provided in a VIVO distribution (dbpedia URLs)


## Notes

There's nothing US specific about this code.  The data file contains US cities.  Edit the data file
to add cities of interest in provinces or regions of interest.

The file cities.n3 is a data package that can be loaded into VIVO.  See the VIVO documentation regarding the
maintenance of data packages.
